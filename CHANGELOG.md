- Fix device `configuration_url`


## v1.2.4 - 28/01/2026

> This version allows you to defined custom host + ports for Recalbox,
> And also to modify it later if needed.

- Add IP address/Host of the Recalbox as an attribute. 
  So it will be available to display in the entity, or to use in scripts / automations.
- Add IP Address/Host and ports as a Diagnostic entity, to be more visible in the device page
- Improve device infos box
- [#2](https://github.com/ooree23/RecalboxHomeAssistant/issues/2) and [#3](https://github.com/ooree23/RecalboxHomeAssistant/issues/3) :
  Add settings to let the user choose different host, and ports for API and UDP, if he configured different ones on Recalbox.
  User can change later the host and ports of the device, it will update the entities.



## v1.2.3 - 26/01/2026

- Update docs and code, because I changed my Github username to `ooree23`.



## v1.2.2 - 26/01/2026


- Implementing a new coordinator with Pings history.
  If the Recalbox didnt answer to all the pings during the last 2 minutes,
  then we consider it's offline. If there is at least one ping OK during the
  the last 2 minutes, then we use the status based on MQTT messages.
- Improve MQTT logs
- Reset the games attributes when the Recalbox turns offline,
  to avoid displaying old data when it restarts


## v1.2.1 - 26/01/2026


- In the dashboard card, remove the interactive switch, to a simple power state icon
- Add an exception when trying to turn on Recalbox from HA (only turn off is supported)
- Externalize the custom_sentences installer to be an sync job
- Externalize Recalbox services installation
- Improve code and logs on assist sentences and intents registration
- For Voice/Text assis, now looks for the Recalbox that are ON, instead of using the 1st one by default.
  Preparing also commands to specify a Recalbox target by name.
- Improve french pausing/resuming sentences



## v1.2.0 - 26/01/2026 Breaking change

> This versions changes the entity from `binary sensor` to `switch`.
> If you installed the previous version, you will need to remove the
> existing binary sensor entity, and use the `switch` in your dashboard
> entity field, and your automations.

- Transforms the binary sensor to a switch entity
- Improve custom_sentences update check algorithm, 
  in order to not ask to reboot if the sentences have no real change
- Improve french custom sentences for intents (more natural)
- Improve dashboard layout and texts
- Remove buttons entities, now using services to avoid Recalbox instance confusion
- User can change the card title with `title` card attribute
- The Recalbox name (inside card) is now friendly name, or entity name, or "Recalbox".
  It allows to know which name should be said to Assist to trun off the switch


## v1.1.0 - 25/01/2026


- Improve documentation
- Improve dashboard translations
- Add description translation of the Custom Card "Recalbox Card" selector, based on the browser language


## v1.0.3 - 25/01/2026

- Reduce ping rate from 60s to 30s, to detect Recalbox disappearing or reappearing.
  To be displayed as ON, the recalbox must received pings AND send ON status via MQTT messages.
  If one of those conditions is false, the recalbox will be shown as OFF.
- Add conversation/assist translations in FR/EN.
  It is based on the assist language.
- Made a pull request to add Recalbox icon in the integration : https://github.com/home-assistant/brands/pull/9269


## v1.0.2 - 25/01/2026

- Fix en/fr empty json files


## v1.0.1 - 25/01/2026

- Add a coordinator, which pings the Recalbox every 1min, to check if it is still ON
- Add HACS integration button in the Github page
- Improve logs
- Internationalisation FR/EN of the Dashboard card
- Set "Recalbox" notification channel on automation example
- Remove screenshot button when Kodi is running



## v1.0.0 - 25/01/2026 - First stable version

- Add a quit current game button, when a game is running


## v0.2.1 - 25/01/2026

- Compare MD5 of sentences files, in order to update them only when required.
  It avoids to show double restart required when the update doesn't change the sentences.



## v0.2.0 - 24/01/2026

- As `extra_folders` is not working, added a script to copy the `custom_components/recalbox/custom_sentences`
  to `custom_sentences`. As this script is launched when the integration starts, you could need two restarts
  to get Assist sentences : a first restart to run the integration, that will copy the sentences ; and a second
  restart, that will read the sentences on start.
- Display in dashboard if the secondary restart is needed.
  The alert is shown when the sentences have been changed.
- Fill the default host when creating your Recalbox, with `recalbox.local`
- Move recalbox entities to "instances" in order to be able to store other "global" variables, like "needs_restart"
  to show info in the dashboard.

 
## v0.1.2 - 24/01/2026

- Try to force HACS to copy `custom_sentences` folder, thanks to `extra_folders` key
- Improve dashboard card actions CSS to make bottom smooth


## v0.1.1 - 24/01/2026

- Deep modification to move recalbox actions in the entity, making buttons and intents only proxies
- Fix shut down with the button, to force and keep status OFF
- If an image path exists, but not the image, do not display the broken image


## v0.1.0 - 24/01/2026

- Changes from Yaml version to Python custom integration

  If it fails, then it tries a screenshot via API.  
  Used both for voice/text command, and button pressed.
- Update dashboard card and button icons
- Improve notify automation example, to avoid wrong notification when Home Assistant updates itself while Recalbox is still off.
- When looking for game name in game launch, remove accents
- Create HACS files to enable repo download via HACS


## v0.0.2 - 20/01/2026

- Update the example dashboard template, to use the device information to display it at the bottom of the Recalbox column
- Moved variables to be changed on top of the `recalbox.yaml` file. The version and hardware are not hardcoded anymore.
- Adds web links to recalbox web manager, and to this repository to get updates
- Try to search for a game even if the recalbox is not seen connected
- Add `recalboxVersion` and `hardware` in the MQTT message sent to Home Assistant. So HA can know the OS version and device of Recalbox.
- Update the recalbox_card example with actual Recabox version and hardware
- Recalbox now sends messages to MQTT in retain mode for the attributes (and then remember the recabox version and hardware)
- Add 2 sensors sensor.recalbox_hardware and sensor.recalbox_firmware_version to persist values

- Home Assistant package configuration complete for receiving Recalbox events, actions to turn off or reboot the recabox, dashboard template, voice/text actions to :
    - know the status of Recalbox (on/off)
    - know the currently played game
    - try to launch a game (not yet working, for know it can search if the file exists, but there is no API to laucnhe the game, and no SSH implementation done yet)
