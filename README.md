## Intro

A script listens on Recalbox events, based on [Scripts sur événements d'EmulationStation | Recalbox Wiki](https://wiki.recalbox.com/fr/advanced-usage/scripts-on-emulationstation-events) . The scripts reads the needed data for game information, and sends a MQTT message to Home Assistant with JSON data. Home Assistant can then update its "Recalbox" entity with the current game.

The attributes read by Home Assistant are, through this JSON :
- `game `: name of the running game, user friendly. null if no game launched.
- `console `: name of the console, user friendly. null if no game launched, or "Kodi"
- `rom `: path to the current rom. null if no game launched.
- `genre `: genre of the running game, user friendly. null if no game launched.
- `genreId `: genreId of the running game. null if no game launched. Can be useful for automation where you want to set lights colors depending on type of game for example.
- `imageUrl `: URL to the image of the current game. null if no game running. The picture exists only if the game has been scrapped.
- `recalboxVersion` : Version of the Recalbox OS
- `hardware` : Device running the Recalbox

Two buttons can also be used to stop/reboot the recalbox via Home Assistant.

Assist integration for voice/text control has also been implemented in order to control, get information, or find a game to launch.


## Context

- You should have a `Recabox `OS available.
  Tested only with Recalbox <mark>9.2.3</mark>, Raspberry Pi 3 B+.
  By default, should be accessible on `recalbox.local`

- You should have a `Home Assistant`.
  Tested on Home Assistant <mark>2026.1</mark>, Raspberry Pi 3 B+.
  By default, It should be accessible in the same network, at`homeassistant.local`

## Installation

1. **Recalbox**
   
   - Copy the file `Recalbox/userscripts/home_assistant_notifier.sh` in the `userscripts` Recalbox folder.
     This script will react to Recabox events :
     
     - `start`|`systembrowsing`|`endgame `: refreshes the status ON, no game
     
     - `runkodi `: refreshes ON status, set the current console as "Kodi"
     
     - `rungame `: refreshes ON status, show current game, console (readable name), and builds image URL base on the scrapped data. If the game has a numeric prefix with 3 digits, it is removed. Example : "001 Sonic 1" will be shown as "Sonic 1".
     
     - `stop `: change status to OFF, remove current game, image

2. **Home Assistant**
   
   - Create a new Home Assistant User, named "recalbox" (or something else), allowed to connect only on the local network. This user will be used for MQTT Authentication. Replace the user/password `home_assistant_notifier.sh` line 13 and 14 (`MQTT_USER` & `MQTT_PASS`)
   
   - Install MQTT Mosquitto broker in Home assistant (in addons). Enable the Run on start, and watchdog.
   
   - In services integration, add MQTT service which should be now available.
     Click on reconfigure, and use the credentials defined for authentication.
	 Double check they are the same defined in `home_assistant_notifier.sh` lines 13+14.
   
   - Copy file `/packages/recalbox.yaml` from this repo, to `/homeassistant/packages/recalbox.yaml`, and add in `configuration.yaml` those lines in order to load this external config file (and then restart HA) :
     
     ```
     homeassistant:
         packages: !include_dir_named packages
     ```
 
## Usage 

### Add Recalbox status to dashboard
 
Add a card to Home Assistant to display the Recalbox status, game info, picture, etc. 
It will be refreshed in real time.

You can use this [recalbox_card.yaml](Home%20Assistant/dashboards/recalbox_card.yaml) in your dashboard, to get this example :
![](example.png)


### Automation when a game is launched

You can also use automations based on launched games.
Example : send phone notification when a game in launched :
 
```yaml
alias: Notification de nouveau jeu
description: Annonce le nouveau jeu qui vient d'être lancé
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.recalbox_rpi3
    attribute: game
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: |-
      {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.game != None and 
         trigger.to_state.attributes.game != 'unknown' and
         trigger.to_state.attributes.console != 'Kodi' and
         trigger.to_state.attributes.game != '' }}
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    metadata: {}
    data:
      message: >-
        Lancement du jeu {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.game -}}

        {%- if trigger.to_state.attributes.console %}, sur {{
        trigger.to_state.attributes.console }}{% endif -%}

        {%- if trigger.to_state.attributes.genre %} ({{
        trigger.to_state.attributes.genre }}){% endif %}.
      title: Jeu sur Recalbox
mode: single
```

### Turn OFF recalbox with text/voice command

Since January 11th 2026, the script added a switch template.
It allows to control the Recalbox as a switch, and use assist to turn OFF recalbox with voice or assist text :

Example : "Eteins Recalbox" will turn off the Recalbox.

### Get current game with text/voice command

- If not yet done, create a file `/config/custom_sentences/<language>/recalbox_intent.yaml`, having a `RecalboxGameStatus` intent.

  You can download the example [custom_sentences/fr/recalbox_intent.yaml](Home%20Assistant/custom_sentences/fr/recalbox_intent.yaml), that already contains this intent in French :

```yaml
language: "fr"
intents:
  RecalboxGameStatus:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "quel est le jeu en cours [sur recalbox]"
          - "à quoi je joue [sur recalbox]"
          - "qu'est-ce qui tourne sur la recalbox"
          - "quel jeu est lancé [sur recalbox]"
          - "quel est le jeu lancé [sur recalbox]"
```

### Launch a game from text/voice assistant

> SSH launch NOT WORKING YET !

> Because of non existing APi to launch a game, we need to launch the game via SSH.
> It means that Home Assistant needs access to Recalbox via SSH.  
> - Enable "Advanced mode" for your user
> - Install "Terminal & SSH" in Home Assistant : enable watchdog and sidebar. Go to settings and import a public key or define a password, and then save and restart the addon.
> - Type "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096", name it "/config/.ssh/recalboxHomeAssistantKey" (create folder /config/.ssh if needed)
> - Your keys will then be sotred in /config/.ssh/recalboxHomeAssistantKey
> - Type "ssh-copy-id -i /config/.ssh/recalboxHomeAssistantKey.pub root@recalbox.local" (default credentials on Recalbox are "root" / "recalboxroot")
> - Verify in the terminal that the SSH connexion is good, without asking you the password anymore : "ssh -i /config/.ssh/recalboxHomeAssistantKey -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@recalbox.local"
> - Type "exit"


- If not yet done, create a file `/config/custom_sentences/<language>/recalbox_intent.yaml`, having a `RecalboxLaunchGame` intent.

  You can download the example [custom_sentences/fr/recalbox_intent.yaml](Home%20Assistant/custom_sentences/fr/recalbox_intent.yaml), that already contains this intent in French :
  
```yaml
language: "fr"
intents:
  (...)
  RecalboxLaunchGame:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "joue à {game} sur [la] {console} sur recalbox"
          - "lance {game} sur [la] {console}"
          - "recalbox lance {game} sur [la] {console}"
```

- If needed, update the systems list in `/config/custom_sentences/fr/recalbox_intent.yaml` with the consoles you want to support/recognize in the launch command.
  By default, it supports launching command on NES, SNES, Megadrive, PSX, N64, GB, GBA, GBC, Dreamcast, PSP.
  
  The search ignores case, and can find roms with words in between your search.
  Example : Searching for "Pokemon Jaune", can find the rom "Pokemon - Version Jaune - Edition Speciale Pikachu".
  
  ![](launchGame.png)
  
  Query examples :
  - "Recalbox lance Pokemon Jaune sur Game Boy"
  - "Recalbox lance Mario 64 sur nintendo 64"
  - "Joue à Mario 64 sur la Nintendo 64 sur Recalbox"
  - "Lance Mario 64 sur la Nintendo 64"
  - "Lance Sonic 1 sur megadrive"


## Todo

- [ ] Implement the launch game via SSH if possible (we already know if we found the game, the rom path, and system. Only need a way to launch it on device)
- [ ] Internationalization


## Releases notes

### v0.0.2 - In progress...

- Update the example dashboard template, to use the device information to display it at the bottom of the Recalbox column
- Moved variables to be changed on top of the `recalbox.yaml` file. The version and hardware are not hardcoded anymore.
- Adds web links to recalbox web manager, and to this repository to get updates
- Try to search for a game even if the recalbox is not seen connected
- Add `recalboxVersion` and `hardware` in the MQTT message sent to Home Assistant. So HA can know the OS version and device of Recalbox.
- Update the recalbox_card example with actual Recabox version and hardware
- Recalbox now sends messages to MQTT in retain mode
- Add SSH installation info to launch a game
- SSH implementation for game launch ???


### v0.0.1 - 13/01/2026

> First integration

- Hardcoded device as a Recalbox 9.2.3 on Raspberry Pi 3 (no effect, only for display). It can be changed with the yaml
- Script on Recalbox side to notify the Home Assistant of any event, and compute the game image URL
- Home Assistant package configuration complete for receiving Recalbox events, actions to turn off or reboot the recabox, dashboard template, voice/text actions to :
	- know the status of Recalbox (on/off)
	- know the currently played game
	- try to launch a game (not yet working, for know it can search if the file exists, but there is no API to laucnhe the game, and no SSH implementation done yet)
